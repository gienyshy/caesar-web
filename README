Deployment
==========
Before doing anything, make sure you have a few packages installed::

  $ sudo aptitude install python-imaging python-ldap

Configuring SSL is a bit trickier, but assuming you already have ``mod_ssl`` 
installed and your working directory is the project root::

  $ sudo a2enmod ssl
  $ sudo cp apache/mitCAclient.pem /etc/ssl/certs/
  $ cd /etc/apache2/sites-enabled
  $ sudo ln -s ../sites-available/default-ssl 000-default-ssl 

The fabfile should take care of the rest, in theory.
